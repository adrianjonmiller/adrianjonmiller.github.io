				With 10 years of experience as a full time web developer and designer, I bring not only creative energy and an expert eye to my projects, but also experience in taking theoretical concepts and making them reality. In my work I create visual design systems that can adapt to any number of forms or formats. Most important to me is that the code I write is a reflection of the quality of the design I create. I am passionate about creating visually engaging interactive interfaces that have fluid and intuitive user experiences.

				I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design at Art Center College of Design. There, I studied identity and branding. I also gained a strong footing in a variety of media, including print, interactive, environmental design, packaging and typography.
				In the time since my graduation, I've worked primarily in web design, and development focusing on front-end languages but with substantial back-end experience as well.
