title: How do I build a website?
---

Starting out as a web designer/developer can be very daunting up front. I've spoken with many people who were interested in learning how to program a site or build a web page, but had a hard time figuring out where to start. There are more platorms and technologies than types of peanut butter and each one has its own niche.

### Learn to use Wordpress ###

I don't recommend wordpress because its the best or most powerful Content Managament System (CMS) out there, but because of how many people use it, how much third party content is available for it and how much documenation is available. Chances are if you are trying to do something, someone has already done it in wordpress, and by typing your question into Google you can find an answer. Wordpress also leverages the web's five most common languages. HTML, CSS, Javascrpt, MySQL and PHP. HTML, CSS and Javascript are used on almost every website in existence and MySQL and PHP are very powerful and widely used.

There are so many website and tutorials on how to build a wordpress site that I'm not going to bother trying to teach you how to build a wordpress site; what I'm going to focus on is how to set yourself up to start building a websites, using an analogy: I don't want to show you how to build a car, but what tools and training you need to start building cars.

### A Local Server 

You're local server is where you will test your site until you're ready to send it out into the world wide web (local just means on your computer). Wordpress requires what's called a LAMP stack in order to run. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. The best way to set up a LAMP sever on your computer is to get either [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/) if you have a Mac, or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/) Windows. Both have very clear explanations on how to install and set up their software on their websites.

The end result of installing either MAMP or WAMP will be a folder on your computer you could think of as your local server. When you type in localhost:8888 \(MAMP\) or localhost/ \(WAMP\) you will be looking at the files in that folder. If you have wordpress files in that folder and the right configurations you will be looked at a worpdress site.
