  description: This was a logo and identity for a local baker. I chose to do the logo
    in a more simple graphic manner in order to differentiate from other more "foofy"
    identities. The spatula was chosen as the icon because many people have a nostalgic
    association with spatulas, licking them during the backing process and I wanted
    that personal associate and sense of craft to be captured in the identity.

This was a logo and identity for a local baker. I chose to do the logo in a more simple graphic manner in order to differentiate from other more "foofy" identities. The spatula was chosen as the icon because many people have a nostalgic association with spatulas, licking them during the backing process and I wanted that personal associate and sense of craft to be captured in the identity.
